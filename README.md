# Assignment 3: Git Branching & Merge Conflict Resolution

## üéØ Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to understand and apply **GitHub Flow** by creating feature branches, making changes to the same file, and resolving merge conflicts using Git.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Summary
This project uses a single HTML file (`index.html`) to demonstrate:
- Creating and working on multiple branches
- Making overlapping edits
- Handling merge conflicts manually
- Merging feature branches successfully

## üîÅ Workflow Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Branch Creation
Two feature branches were created from the `main` branch:
- Branch A -> `feature/add-content`: Focused on adding new content to `index.html`
- Branch B -> `feature/update-styling`: Focused on updating styling and tailwindcss in `index.html`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 2: Creating a Conflict
Both branches made changes to the same sections of the file, which led to a **merge conflict** during the second pull request.

### üîß Step 3: Conflict Resolution
While merging `feature/add-content` after `feature/update-styling`, a conflict occurred. To resolve it:
1. Git highlighted the conflicting code
2. The file was manually edited to combine both changes
3. Conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) were removed
4. Final version was tested and committed
5. The merge was completed without losing any updates

## üì∏ Visual Demonstration

- ### Styling & Content Branch Merged

- ### Conflict Detection and Resolution which is Resolved Manually and Final Output

## üìò Key Learnings
- Conflicts are normal when collaborating on the same files
- Manual conflict resolution is essential to preserve everyone‚Äôs work
- Following GitHub Flow ensures a clean and trackable development process
